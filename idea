- approaches:
  - SIFT matching
  - CJG shape-based matching
    - book segmentation
      - detect book shapes (i.e. rectangles) using Hough
    - shape-based matching between model and detected rectangles
      - edge detection on model
      - edge detection on rectangle
      - compute similarity (set appropriate threshold)
